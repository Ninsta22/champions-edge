# Champion's Edge

This is the Github Repository for the Champion's Edge: League of Legends champion recommender. The code in this repository, and in this README, will go over how to download the dataset, properly parse/clean the dataset, and run the necessary Machine Learning Model. It also goes over the methodology and experimentation done to properly find the feature space and machine learning models that yielded the best results.
